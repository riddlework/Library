Description	: Design documentation to accompany MyLibrary.java, LibraryController.java, 
			  LibraryModel.java, and Book.java
			  
			  
---------- Design choices regarding classes : 

To implement the library collection we decided to follow the same View-Controller-Model format that was used in the "Cryptograms" project. 
This design choice allowed us to maintain separation between our view class, which served as a UI, and our Model class, which served as
a means to manipulate our data to meet the requirements of the project spec. By doing so, we were able to house our important data in the
model class and safely pass necessary data to the UI, via the controller, without violating the rules of safe encapsulation. The separation
that we achieved with this format was beneficial because it facilitated a class for user input and program response, a class for data storage
and manipulation, and a class for safe passage between the two. 

Additionally, we implemented a fourth class (Book) that symbolized a book in the users collection/library. This design implementation 
permitted the existence of unique objects that could contain important attributes. Since the implementation of of the user commands was
reliant on the manipulation of book properties, having a class that could be instantiated for each book was essential to the construction of the 
class structure. Also, having this unique Book class allowed simplification of the LibraryModel class. We were able to use simple pre-existing data 
structures to hold the book objects rather than creating a more complex class for the library.
